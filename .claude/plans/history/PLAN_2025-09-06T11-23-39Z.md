## 2) Progress

- **Current Step:** 9
- **Completed Steps:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Notes:**
  - Both apps use Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
  - Need to ensure backward compatibility during migration
  - Focus on server-side patterns for better security
  - Step 1 completed: Created auth package structure with TypeScript config, tsup build setup, and subpath exports
  - Package builds successfully with turbo build
  - Step 2 completed: Implemented comprehensive type definitions including auth config, user/profile types, session types, provider interfaces, database schemas, and error types
  - Step 3 completed: Created Supabase client factories for browser, server (with service role option), and middleware contexts with proper cookie handling and SSR support
  - Step 4 completed: Implemented core auth functions (signIn, signUp, signOut, OAuth), profile management (CRUD operations), and session management with strong typing throughout
  - Step 5 completed: Added multi-provider support with Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, and Email/Password providers, all implementing a common base interface with proper error handling and strong typing
  - Step 6 completed: Created React hooks (useAuth, useUser, useRole, usePermission) and components (AuthProvider, AuthGuard, RoleGuard) with SSR support and strong typing using type guards
  - Step 7 completed: Implemented middleware utilities including auth middleware, session management, and route protection with composable functions and preset configurations
  - Step 8 completed: Added comprehensive error handling with custom AuthError classes, error handlers with retry/circuit breaker patterns, integrated @draft-gen/logger package instead of console, and created input validation utilities with strong typing

## 3) Next Step Preview

Step 9 will integrate the auth package into the convertext application. This involves replacing convertext's existing authentication implementation with the new shared package, updating imports, and ensuring all functionality continues to work correctly.
